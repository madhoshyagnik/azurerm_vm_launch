## (public_key = var.ssh_public_key): Save the public key you want to authenticate with as terraform variable on app.terraform.io 


# Save below variables as enviroment variables on app.terraform.io

## ARM_CLIENT_ID: 

## ARM_CLIENT_SECRET:

## ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID:

## ARM_TENANT_ID:

## Choose Terraform variable if the empty variable is defined in terraform configuration (ssh_public_key, ssh_private_key), in that case it'll look for the value as a Terraform variable on [hcp.terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) 

## For Variables such as Client ID, Secret, Tenant ID and Sub ID, since these aren't even declared in the Terrform configuration they should be set as Environment Variables on [hcp.terraform](https://app.terraform.io/)
